# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Summary
This module covers the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), providing a solid foundation for software development using object-oriented paradigms.

## Module Content
### 1. Object-Oriented Programming
- **Procedural Programming:** Focuses on procedures or routines.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Focuses on objects that contain data and methods.

### 2. Class Diagrams
- **Classes:** Represented by rectangles with three compartments (name, attributes, methods).
- **Relationships:**
  - **Association:** A "uses-a" relationship.
  - **Aggregation:** A "has-a" relationship, where parts can exist independently.
  - **Composition:** A "contains-a" relationship, where parts cannot exist independently.

### 3. Core OOP Concepts
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
- **Classes:** Blueprints for objects that define data and behaviors.
- **Objects:** Instances of a class with their own set of data and methods.
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).
- **Inheritance:** Mechanism where a new class (derived or child class) is created from an existing class.
- **Polymorphism:** The ability of an object to take on many forms.
- **ENUM:** A special class representing a group of constants.

### 4. OOP Design Principles
- **Coupling:** The degree of dependency between classes or modules.
- **Cohesion:** The degree to which elements within a module belong together.
- **SOLID Principles:** A set of guidelines for creating flexible and maintainable software.
  - SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP.
